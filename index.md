# Line Following Robot
My robot is an autonomous, wheeled vehicle that uses light sensors to detect a line, and follow it using dc motors.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is connecting the arduino, h-bridge, battery pack, and front DC motors onto the chassis of the car. I also attached the front wheels, soldered wires to connect the back motors to the h-bridge, connected one IR sensor, and wrote functions to move the car forwards, backwards, left, and right. My biggest challenge was the soldering, because this was my first time learning to solder, so I had to practice a bit first before soldering for my project. After this, I was able to successfully solder and connect the motors to the h-bridge.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone is setting up the arduino and the h-bridge in order to move DC motors. To do this, I connected each motor to the h-bridge using alligator clips to distribute the current from a 6V battery pack, and the h-bridge to the arduino as well. Four digital pins connected on the arduino corresponded to spinning the motors in different directions. By passing input, 'HIGH' or 'LOW,' to each pin using the digitalWrite function, I was able to control each motor to spin forwards or backwards with various high-low combinations. Using these different combinations, I will eventually be able to turn the car left and right as well. Despite challenges in securing the battery pack's thin wires under the screws of the h-bridge, I was able to overcome the issues by stripping each wire to expose more of the wire to grip.
